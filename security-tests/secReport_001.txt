Vulnerability assesment Report
-------------------------------

Executive Summary
----------------
    Target application 
        -->  rx2 server

    Vulnerability name 
        -->  Missing Rate Limiting at the login page

    Severity:
        --> High

    status:
        --> open / unremediated

Vulnerability Description:
--------------------------

    --> The web application login endpoint does not restrict the number of times a user can retry a
    --> failed login from a single ip address. This allows a remote attack try thousands of passwords
    --> for an account until they find the correct password. An attacker can use automated tools like
    --> <ffuf> to brute the correct account and its password. This is possible because the login page 
    --> does not implement account lockout policy or rate limiting.

Technical Impact:
-----------------
    --> Unauthorized Access:
        Attackers can use they passwords and accounts found to login to the application.

    --> Account takeover:
        Attackers can simply change the password of the account once they login hence preventing
        real users from accessing the application.

    --> Resource Exaustion:
        Rapid requests can spike the CPU usage of the web server leading to a denial of service attack(DOS).

Proof of Concept(PoC):
---------------------
    The vulnerability was confirmed by using the following steps:
        --> capture a legitimate login request using burpsuite

        --> modify the request to include the FUZZ keyword in the password field.

        --> execute the bruteforce attack using ffuf with the rockyou.txt password list
            the command ran:
                --> ffuf -request login.txt -request-proto https -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

        --> the tool succesfully identified the correct password due to lack of rate Limiting.

Remediation:
-----------

    To secure the application implement rate limiting on all pages of the application
    to stop all automated attacks against it.

Conclusion:
----------
    Implementing rate limiting and account lockout policy is a critical line of defense for 
    any application on the wide world web against bruteforce tools.
