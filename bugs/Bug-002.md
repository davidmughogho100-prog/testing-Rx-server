# Bug ID: Bug-002

# Title:
    the profile page allows 255 characters for the fields which breaks the ui for the full name

# Module:
    UI/Profile

# Seveity:
    Medium

# priority:
    High

# Environment:
    android

# steps to reproduce:
    1. login into the app
    2. on the top profile menu click the edit button
    3. In the full name field paste a long string of text at max 255
    4. then fill the rest of the fields.
    6. click on the save button
    7. click the back arrow
    8. on the lower menu bar click on the more menu

# Actual Result:
    --> the profile menu stretches downward to contain the long full name

# Expected Result:
    --> the full name field should allow only a few character 
    --> the fields should limit the strings to a lower number than 255 characters to avoid breaking the UI
